EU Users and our lawful basis for using your data
Data protection law in Europe contains a number of legal justifications for allowing us to have and use your personal information. We comply with the GDPR and want to ensure we have a lawful basis for using all EU user data. Our lawful reasons include:

Performing our contract with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver access to Todo applications.
Legal compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data. For example, we might pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity to law enforcement.
Legitimate interests: if we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not materially impact your interests and rights, then we’re in compliance. We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a manner that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business. For example, we will send you promotional communications about our service, subject to your legal rights to opt-out. We also analyze how Users interact with our Site and the Todo applications so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well. This allows us to develop and improve the quality of the online experience we offer all our Users.
Information Processing
ToDoAPP by NFI only holds the information absolutely necessary for using our services. The information ToDoAPP by NFI collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. While ToDoAPP by NFI owns the ToDoAPP by NFI application’s code, databases, and all rights, you retain all rights to your data. Without your prior authorization,  we will not have access to the content you create.

ToDoAPP by NFI uses third-party services and hosting partners who are also GDPR-compliant, such as AWS, Stripe, and Google. In such instances, we take essential security methods to guarantee that we comply with GDPR when sending and receiving data from third parties.

ToDoAPP by NFI will never sell your personal data to any third party, and we will never share data with third parties without your permission.

Data Retention
All your private and personal information will be permanently deleted from our systems upon processing your request to have your account deleted.
